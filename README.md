resuming some experiments with vala - has lots of advantages over C and I saw some beauty in using it to generate code for the Freetronics 4 x 4 x 4 cube

building vala seemed to go well but executing the result needs some attention.
However valac <filename.vala>   seems to work OK
Checkout the anjutaExample  : builds and executes OK
